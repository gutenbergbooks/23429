Washington, D. C.</p>

<p class='noin'>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I am taking the liberty of writing you this letter since I read your
published volume, &ldquo;Logical Control: The Computer vs. Brain&rdquo;
(Silliman Memorial Lecture Series, 1957), with the hope that you can
perhaps offer me some advice and also publish this letter in the
editorial section. Your mathematical viewpoint on the analysis between
computing machines and the living human brain, especially the conclusion
that the brain operates in part digitally and in part analogically,
using its own statistical language involving selection, conditional
transfer orders, branching, and control sequence points, et cetera,
makes me feel that only you can offer me some information with logical
<i>arithmetic depth</i>.</p>

<p>The questions raised in this letter are designed principally to reach
the embryonic and juvenile scientists &hellip; the <i>scientists-elect</i>, so to
speak. (I think the &ldquo;mature scientists&rdquo; are irretrievably
lost.) For many reasons, some of which will be explained in the
following paragraphs, I think that it is of the greatest importance that
some stimulatable audience be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
reached. As yet, the beginners have no rigid scientific biases and thus
may have sufficient curiosity and flexibility about the world in which
they live to approach experimentation with a mind devoid of &ldquo;the
hierarchy of memory registers which have programmed in erroneous
data.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What I have to say will not surprise nor shock <i>you</i>, or those who are
at present engaged in scientific investigation. In fact, I have read
many science-fiction stories that deal with the same problem. Perhaps
that is the only way that it can be approached, through the medium of a
story? Yet why not present it for what it may be? Let me tell it my own
way, and then, please, let me have your <i>coldly logical</i> opinion.</p>

<p>As to my background, I am a graduate student in the Zoology Department
of a midwestern university working toward a Master&rsquo;s degree, or
actually a doctorate&mdash;we can bypass the M.S. if we choose&mdash;in the field
of Cellular Physiology. My sponsor is an internationally known man in
the field. The area of research that I have selected is concerned with
the effects of physical and chemical agents on the synthesis of nucleic
acids of the cell. Obviously, this is a big field, and I hope to select
from among the different agents, one or two that will give
&ldquo;positive results.&rdquo; I have been doing active research for
about half a year testing the different agents. As for the <i>fundamental</i>
questions raised, I am positive that it would make <i>no</i> difference in
what field of science I were to work.</p>

<p>By now I have had enough course work to realize that when performing any
assigned laboratory exercise&mdash;they should not be called
experiments&mdash;even of a cook-book type, little or even major
discrepancies arise, and <i>always on the initial trials</i>, no matter how
carefully one works! As you are probably aware, the teaching assistant
in charge of the lab or the instructor, generally runs through the
exercise before the class does in order to get the &ldquo;bugs&rdquo;
out of it&mdash;I am deliberately generalizing, since the above holds for all
of the laboratory sciences&mdash;so when the student gets confusing or rather
contradictory results, the instructor can deftly point out the error in
the setup or calculations, or <i>what have you</i>. He may <i>even</i> indicate
what results may be expected. <i>The last is critical.</i> Similarly other
students in the laboratory usually have friends who have had the course
before and know what results are expected&mdash;<i>this technique is frowned
upon</i>. Or one may consult textbooks and published papers. (This, by the
way, is known as <i>library research</i>, and is generally conceded to be
indicative of the superior student, especially if he points out the fact
that he is <i>so interested</i> that he just had to delve into the
literature.) By any technique, <i>the expected results are always
obtained</i>. <i>Always. And by everyone.</i> The initial confusions&mdash;that some
<i>honest</i> students perpetuate&mdash;are easily <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
brushed aside as errors due to inexperience, sloppiness, lack of
initiative, stupidity of congenital sort, et cetera, et cetera.</p>

<p>Since being a teaching fellow, even simple cook-book experiments
don&rsquo;t seem as cook-bookish. Some pretty weird things have happened
when I tried out an exercise prior to the class. Fortunately, I was
taught to keep data&mdash;in duplicate: indelible purple Hexostick original
and carbon copy. These, <i>vide infra</i>, are a few of such happenings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c'>Elementary General Physiology Laboratory:</p>

<p class='hi'>1. Initial maximal vagal stimulation:<br />

<i>Expected results</i>: inhibition of heart beat.<br />

<i>Obtained results</i>: one series of increased heart beats. (Possible
explanation: I missed the vagus nerve)????</p>

<p class='hi'>2. <i>Frog nerve-muscle preparation</i>:<br />

<i>Expected results</i>: a single muscle twitch.<br />

<i>Obtained results</i>: a beautiful nerve twitch.<br />

(Explanation: Eyesight? How can <i>nerves</i> twitch?)??</p>

<p class='hi'>3. <i>Hypotonic hemolysis</i>:<br />

<i>Expected results</i>: red blood cell destruction.<br />

<i>Obtained results</i>: crenation.<br />

(Explanation: switched salt solutions <i>unconsciously</i>)?????</p>

<p class='hi'>4. <i>Curarized muscle preparation</i>:<br />

<i>Expected results</i>: a synaptic block with no response of nerve when
stimulated.<br />

<i>Observed results</i>: a typical strychnine response, violent
<i>tetanus</i>, et cetera.<br />

(Explanation: again, I switched bottles)????</p>

<p class='hi'>5. I shall avoid the obvious mention of mishaps with mechanical or
electrical pieces of equipment. I assure you there were similar
deviations in initial attempts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since I realize that you are preparing a paper on <i>Memory Registers:
Stimulation Criteria</i>, for the VIth Annual International Meeting of the
Society of Theoretical Biomathematicians in London, and are short of
time, I shall avoid going into the same kind of detail as the above for
other Biology Labs, and get into the real heart of the thing &hellip; the
research problem. (After all that is what both of us are interested in.)
By the way, please send me a reprint of the paper when it comes out.</p>

<p>I guess I am really hepped up on this, because I&rsquo;ve just got to
point out for emphasis other incidences usually of a type that involved
missing a whole organ in dissections or a tissue structure in histology
only on the <i>first</i> study, and then re-reading the assignment&mdash;after
knowing what to look for&mdash;and <i>subsequently finding it exactly where it
is said to be</i>. (Ever hunt for an unknown quality&mdash;or quantity?) <i>So it
was there all the time</i>, sloppy technique? Or is this branching at a
control point? <i>cf.</i> LC: C. vs. B. p. 251.</p>

<p>To get back to my thesis research, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the pieces of equipment that I have been using in the research are
fairly standard in physiological research: a Beckman spectrophotometer,
a Coleman photometer, a van Slyke amino nitrogen apparatus, a Warburg
respirometer, pH meters, Kjeldahls, Thunbergs, et cetera. Mostly,
I&rsquo;m in the process of getting used to them. Also there is a high
voltage X-ray generator, U. V. source and other equipment for
irradiation purposes. We also have an A. E. C. license so that we can
get at least microcurie amounts of the usual isotopes for
radioautographic work.</p>

<p>Now the literature in my area is pretty controversial. (You can
appreciate <i>that</i>, especially since Bergbottom at the Kaiser Wilhelm
Institute bombarded you with criticisms of your theories.) Different and
actually contradictory results have been obtained for the same substance
in the same organism, <i>e. g.</i> alkaline phosphatase in the frog liver
cell (Monnenblick, &rsquo;55, Tripp, &rsquo;56, and Stone, &rsquo;57).
To give an example, when I start a run for respiration effects using a
Warburg I don&rsquo;t know what results to expect. Whenever this has
been the case, my results have been confusing &hellip; to say the least.</p>

<p>On nitrogen-mustard treated cells, in some instances the controls
respired significantly <i>more</i>&mdash;even with a statistical analysis of
variance&mdash;in some instances the <i>experimentals</i> respired significantly
more; and in other cases the respiration for both was <i>exactly</i> the
same&mdash;even <i>closer</i> than the expected deviations that should be found in
any random population. One run, the blank run, <i>containing no cells</i> &hellip;
and grease-free &hellip; consumed the greatest amount of oxygen. To cut this
letter short, the same inconstancies apply to other trials that I have
made. Whenever I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect, and particularly
where the literature was controversial, my results have been completely
haywire.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I was not happy with this so I discussed it with other
graduate students. They have all encountered the <i>same thing</i>! But most
professors won&rsquo;t admit this to be true and merely tell me that my
technique is lousy. If anything, I am an overly careful worker. Why is
it when I <i>know</i> what results are expected, I get comparable results
even on the <i>first</i> trial?</p>

<p>Remember, <i>I obtained the expected results</i> when the literature
wasn&rsquo;t confused or when my sponsor&mdash;a most important man in my
life&mdash;gave me a clue as to what kind of results to expect. <i>Only then.</i></p>

<p>Now this is the heart of the matter&hellip; The obvious explanation is the
lack of experience. But, and this is what haunts me &hellip; <i>what if those
so-called contradictory results are meaningful</i>? What if they were
executed with care&mdash;<i>and they were</i>&mdash;and are not the results of
sloppiness or inexperience? <i>What if a nerve can twitch?</i></p>

Editor, Journal of the National Academy of Sciences,<br />

Washington, D. C.</p>

<p class='noin'>Dear Dr. Von Engen:</p>

<p>I would like to thank you for your encouraging letter and advice. I
agree completely with your statement that science has a long way to go
before we can explain the various inconsistencies that crop up in
research. But I certainly can&rsquo;t see how the letter is far too
&ldquo;unsophisticated&rdquo; for inclusion in the <i>Letters to the
Editor</i> portion of your journal. While your letter should have calmed
me, I feel even more strongly now after a year of research about the
matter than I did before. I have deliberately postponed answering your
letter until I had more <i>facts</i>.</p>

<p>I now find that I have accumulated&mdash;as you suggested&mdash;three distinctly
conflicting groups of data on nucleic acid synthesis of frog liver
cells:</p>

<p>1. There is a conversion of ribonucleic acid to desoxyribonucleic acid.</p>

<p>2. There is a conversion of desoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid.</p>

<p>3. The synthesis of both types of nucleic acid are independent of each
other. (In addition, I have some data &hellip; that I don&rsquo;t want to
think about too much &hellip; that shows that there is absolutely no nucleic
acid in the liver cell.) Thus, these data all accumulated by
experimental work, support all three hypotheses. Moreover, the
literature supports <i>all three hypotheses</i>. I intend to go to the Woods
Hole, Massachusetts Marine Lab this summer with my sponsor and get some
new ideas there, especially since Professor Gould M. Rice from the
University of London will be there presenting a seminar series on his
work in nucleic acid synthesis in <i>Oryzias</i>.</p>

<p>The point is not that there is a conflict in the data, but that the data
conflict because there is a conflict in my mind and in the literature.
<i>Don&rsquo;t you see it?</i> As you said on page 20 of &ldquo;Logical
Control: Computer vs. Brain&rdquo;: &ldquo;the order-system&mdash;this means
the problem to be solved, the interaction of the user&mdash;is communicated
to the machine by &lsquo;loading&rsquo; it into the memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p class='noin'>Dear Dr. Bob:</p>

<p>Again, many thanks for your letter&mdash;and encouragement. I especially
treasure the inscribed copy of &ldquo;Logical Control: Computer vs.
Brain,&rdquo; and the current reprint. I am sorry that I didn&rsquo;t
get an opportunity to get down to Washington en route to Woods Hole and
talk over the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
whole thing over a bottle of beer, <i>dark beer</i>. From what I hear of the
demands on a first-rate mathematician&rsquo;s time these days, you
should be grateful that I didn&rsquo;t get to see you, because I would
have monopolized <i>all</i> your time. I appreciate your generosity in
extending the invitation as a rain check to me.</p>

<p>Your mention of the Duke School of &ldquo;psychology&rdquo;&mdash;my
quotes&mdash;leaves me cold. It&rsquo;s too obvious and puts the cart before
the horse. The important point that I was trying to make dealt not with
the &ldquo;possible parapsychological&rdquo; manipulation of equipment
or the materials <i>a la</i> telekinesis to produce the desired results, <i>but
that our Science may not be studying natural phenomena and trying to
interpret them at all</i>. The point, to get it down in black and white, is
that our &ldquo;Science&rdquo;&mdash;yes, quotes&mdash;may be <i>inventing</i> the
reality that it is supposedly studying. <i>Inventing the atoms, molecules,
cells, nuclei, et cetera &hellip; and then describing them, and in the
description giving them reality.</i></p>

<p>While I was at Woods Hole I had some really good bull sessions about
this very thing. I realize now that I may have been falling into the
trap of solipsism, &ldquo;who watches the quad,&rdquo; et cetera, type
of thing. Incidentally, my research is finally beginning to fall into
shape. My sponsor and I had some pretty good sessions about it, and some
of the screwy results I wrote you begin to make sense. I had the good
luck to talk to an outstanding man in the field of nucleic acid
synthesis and he was quite enthusiastic about the caliber of our work.
He feels quite strongly&mdash;but has no real evidence&mdash;that the synthesis of
both types of nucleic acid are independent of each other and has pointed
out some significant references that I did not know about. I&rsquo;m
anxious to buckle down and really lick this nucleic acid problem &hellip; in
time for a June degree.</p>

<p><span class='ralign'>Cordially,</span><br />
<span class='ralign'>Jonathan</span><br /></p>

<p class='noin'>P.S.</p>

<p>Please send me a reprint of your lecture on &ldquo;Memory
Banks&mdash;Transistorized Neurones.&rdquo; The lecture was ingenious, but
there are some biological phenomena with which I don&rsquo;t agree.
Remember, I&rsquo;m the biologist. Honestly, Doc, don&rsquo;t you
think&mdash;<i>entre nous</i>&mdash;that your idea that a living organism, can be
compared with automata in picking up informational items and processing
them simultaneously in parallel, rather than in series, is naif?</p>

<p class='noin'>Dear Dr. Von Engen:</p>

<p>I apologize for not answering your letter sooner. I assume you were
pulling my leg when you suggested that I make a science-fiction story
out of &ldquo;the confused ideas of a beginning graduate student.&rdquo;
You might <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
give <i>your</i> idea of a &ldquo;possible science-fiction story&rdquo; to
one of your acolytes that has some small experience in the field of
writing&mdash;not science. I am afraid that your other suggestions are
not germane to the problem of nucleic acid synthesis and metabolism, a
problem that has been occupying <i>all</i> my time. In fact, I&rsquo;ve been
doing with three to four hours of sleep these days. With the kind of
concentration that I can offer the problem, there is no question that
the data are falling into line, and our research is going rather well.
We will show, I hope, fairly conclusively that there is little or no
interconversion between the two types of nucleic acid synthesis in the
cell.</p>

<p>Despite your ingenious mathematical approaches for stimulation criteria,
in biological research&mdash;a very abstruse field&mdash;even your multiplex
machines with elaborate means of intercommunication are not
sophisticated enough&mdash;or ever will be&mdash;to cope with the complexities
inherent in the numerous interacting biosyntheses on the subcellular
ultratopographical level of protoplasm.</p>

<p class='noin'>My dear Professor Von Engen:</p>

<p>From the tenor of your last letter it is quite evident that there has
been a radical change in your originally sound and inspired ideas, and
which clearly indicates to me that a discussion and exchange of basic
concept would be fruitless. I&rsquo;m rather hurt that you question my
integrity with the statement about the &ldquo;slick, calculating,
career-minded cult of Ph. Deism.&rdquo; Moreover, I would appreciate, if
possible, the return of my previous correspondence.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel that I am totally inept, for I have been awarded a
predoctoral fellowship that will support me during the remainder of
graduate school. In addition, I am being seriously considered for a
faculty position at an outstanding Eastern University upon completion of
my thesis. Should you be interested, we now have an article in press on
the Journal of Cellular Physiology entitled: &ldquo;Nucleic acid
synthesis in the frog liver cell: A definitive study.&rdquo; We have
found substantial evidence which demonstrates that there is no
interconversion of the two types of nucleic acid.</p>

<p>I cannot help but comment about your recent paper in <i>Scientia</i>&mdash;I do
not believe that it is at all possible to devise computers which can
handle the species of data which we obtain. Your data being less
complex, of course, may fit.</p>

<p><i>Naturally</i>, I have your confidence in the entire matter.</p>
